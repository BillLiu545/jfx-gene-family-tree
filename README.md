# jfx-gene-family-tree
In this repos is a project simulating genetic makeup across a family tree of given organisms. There is functionality to add/remove family members, as well as mutating them and comparing each's genetic makeup.

# How does it work?
We start off with an empty family tree represented as a TreeMap. Each entry in the TreeMap represents an organism with a given number and randomly generated genetic makeup as a string. The user can add new family members or remove a family member based on given input by clicking on the buttons. In the menu is functionality to mutate/rearrange genetic makeup of a family member, and comparing two family members based on the same genetic composition, both also based on user input.
